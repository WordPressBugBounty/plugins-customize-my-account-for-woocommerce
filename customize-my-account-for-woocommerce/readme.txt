<h3>Modify the default WooCommerce endpoints</h3>
- This is the most important feature of this plugin just after activation using checkboxes you exclude/include/rename existing endpoints. set icons to existing and new endpoint/links. Plugin support three types of library as of now for icons. Font Awesome, Dashicons and you can also upload your own icon. 
Plugin also seamlessly integrates itself with third party endpoints. It recognises the existing endpoint. Best part is that you can even reorder/rename that
third party endpoint. In certain cases if you want this plugin to take over third party endpoint, just hide the existing third party endpoint by unchecking
the checkbox then create new endpoint with same slug and it will work fine. For example you have Rewards Endpoint that are sourced from any other plugin which has revwards slud. in that case if you want full control as other endpoints just hide existing endpoint and add new endpoint with rewards slug and it will just work fine.
